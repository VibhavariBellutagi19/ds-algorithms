# BubbleSort

### Definition

- comparison sort method - with every algorithm we, we trying to do sorting for every pass. ( sorting step by step )
- in every step, compare adjacent elements
- inner loop runs from i + 1 to length - i - 1 ( because the largest element will be at end and which is sorted)

### Time complexity

- O(N^2) -> N is number of comparison
